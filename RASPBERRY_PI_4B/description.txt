This project was developed using the Raspberry Pi model B and aims to create a Discord bot that does some tasks according to what the user asks. These tasks are: turn on the led, turn off the led and read the temperature value read by the TC74 sensor.
Communication with the sensor is done by I2C. We have connections made between the board and the raspberry pi through the GPIO's intended for both the sensor and the leds.
